    <p>Hello! My name is Scott, I am a software developer. I graduated
    Nashville Software School, a six month bootcamp where I worked on individual
    and team projects in simulated mock Agile environment. I enjoyed it so much that
    I continue to volunteer as a teaching assistant in their web application devlopment
    jumpstart mini-bootcamp. I enjoy learning new things and learning to code feels like I
    joined a community of learners and problem solvers. Building things, finding solutions,
    making connections, and being part of team are some of the best parts. I like the intrinsic
    satisfaction that comes with persevering through challenging problems. I like that applications
    and services are built by a community of people, many using open source software and
    interactions on forums, to serve a need or a want for a community of people.
    I am currently working with Python, Django, Django REST Framework, SQLite, React,
    JavaScript, HTML 5, CSS3. </p>

    <p>Prior to software development, I taught middle school math, was a farm-to-school program
        coordinator and wellness policy advocate for a non-profit urban farm, a public health
        researcher and program coordinator. I have a background in anthropology and I have spent
        over 12 years of my life, part and full-time, in the hospitality industry as a dishwasher,
        cook, bartender, waiter, and manager.
    </p>
